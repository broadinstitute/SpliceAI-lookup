<body style="font-family: monospace">
  This tool computes SpliceAI scores by running the SpliceAI model on your variant(s). <br />
  <br />
  Features:<br />
  - compute scores for any variant, including in-dels that aren't in precomputed tables published by the SpliceAI team<br />
  - see separate probabilities for each category - splice donor, splice acceptor - and not just for the category with the highest probability. <br />
  - adjust model parameters such as -D <br />
